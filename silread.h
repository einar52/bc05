	BC_BASE	is the base directory for storage of waveform data,
		default is /sil/bc
	BC_DEBUG  controls printout of diagnostig messages. Default is 3
		BC_DEBUG should be between 1 and 9.

	contains data that includes sTime. Currently all data from
	one file (save) is returned but in the future data from more
	than one file will be combined as needed.
	If data is not found, a null pointer is returned.

        n = getwdata(sta,stime,comp,nsec,freq,data,rtime,sens,dig,sync)

Channel is 0 for Z, 1 for N-Z and 2 for E-W
If data is found, the number samples placed in data is returned.
If not data is found,  zero is returned.
rtime is unixtime for start of data returned.
On return send and dig contain fields from  4th line from the sil 
format file where names
of sensor and digitizer are placed, example: LE1 RD3
The 6th line is placed  sync, example: 171 399 -4 0 0
